## Technical Constraints

### Browser Compatibility

- The application targets modern browsers with good CSS Variable support.
- Responsive design ensures compatibility with various device sizes.

### Performance Considerations

- Server components are used for content-heavy sections to reduce client-side JavaScript.
- Static rendering is employed where possible for improved performance.
- Images and assets are optimized for fast loading.

### Accessibility Requirements

- Material UI provides accessible components by default.
- Proper semantic HTML is used throughout the application.
- Color contrast meets WCAG guidelines.
- Keyboard navigation is supported for all interactive elements.

## Dependencies and Integrations

### Key Dependencies

- **@emotion/react** and **@emotion/styled**: Styling solution
- **@mui/icons-material** and **@mui/material**: UI components and icons
- **framer-motion**: Animation library
- **next**: Core framework
- **react** and **react-dom**: UI library
- **react-hook-form**: Form management

### External Integrations

- Currently, no external API integrations are implemented.
- The application is designed to be easily extendable for future integrations.

## Build and Deployment Process

### Build Process

1. Code is pushed to the main branch
2. GitHub Actions workflow is triggered
3. Dependencies are installed using pnpm
4. Application is built using Next.js build process
5. Built application is deployed to Vercel

### Deployment Environments

- **Production**: Deployed from the main branch
- **Development**: Local development environment

### Monitoring and Analytics

- No specific monitoring or analytics tools are currently implemented.
- Future implementation could include tools like Google Analytics or Vercel Analytics.
