# Active Context: Antigua Digital Landing Page

## Current Focus
The Antigua Digital Landing Page project is currently in its initial development phase. The focus is on establishing the core structure and implementing the basic landing page functionality with the hero section.

## Recent Changes
- Set up the Next.js 15 project with TypeScript
- Configured Chakra UI and Material UI as the primary UI libraries
- Implemented the basic layout structure with providers
- Created the hero section with content loaded from JSON
- Set up the GitHub Actions workflow for deployment to Vercel

## Active Decisions

### Content Management Approach
The project has adopted a file-based content management approach using JSON files in the `/content` directory. This decision allows for:
- Easy content updates without code changes
- Clear separation of content and presentation
- Potential for future expansion to a headless CMS if needed

### UI Library Integration
The project uses both Chakra UI and Material UI, which requires careful integration:
- Chakra UI serves as the primary component library
- Material UI provides additional components and icons
- The providers are configured to work together without conflicts
- Theme integration ensures consistent styling across both libraries

### Styling Strategy
The current styling approach combines:
- Component-based styling through Chakra UI props
- Global CSS variables for theme properties
- CSS modules for page-specific styling
- This hybrid approach balances component encapsulation with global theme consistency

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Expand the landing page with additional sections (features, benefits, testimonials)
2. Implement responsive design for all viewport sizes
3. Add navigation components (header, footer)
4. Enhance visual design with animations and transitions
5. Implement form components for lead capture

### Upcoming Considerations
- Performance optimization for Core Web Vitals
- Accessibility audit and improvements
- SEO optimization with metadata
- Analytics integration for conversion tracking
- A/B testing capability for optimizing conversion

## Active Technical Considerations

### Component Architecture
- Deciding on the granularity of components
- Balancing server and client components for optimal performance
- Establishing patterns for component composition and reuse

### State Management
- Currently using minimal state with primarily static content
- May need to evaluate more robust state management if interactive features increase
- Considering React Context for theme and potentially user preferences

### Performance Optimization
- Implementing image optimization for assets
- Evaluating code splitting strategies
- Monitoring bundle size as components are added

## Current Challenges

### UI Library Integration
- Ensuring consistent theming between Chakra UI and Material UI
- Managing potential style conflicts between libraries
- Optimizing bundle size with multiple UI libraries

### Content Strategy
- Determining the right balance of static and dynamic content
- Establishing patterns for content updates and management
- Planning for potential internationalization requirements

### Development Workflow
- Setting up efficient local development processes
- Establishing code quality standards and review processes
- Implementing testing strategies for components and pages
